## Project info

**Story Generator** – This project allows users to generate interactive stories with a unique twist:  
At the end of each story, you're presented with **three possible endings**, and you get to **choose the one you like best**.  
It's a creative and fun way to explore branching narratives and empower user choice in storytelling.
